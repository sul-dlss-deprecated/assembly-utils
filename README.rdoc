==Running tests

You will need to be on the Stanford network (not wifi) or VPNed in to run the tests, since it connects to DOR.  To run the tests

bundle exec rspec spec

==Connecting to DOR

Some of the methods require a connection to DOR, which is not provided as part of this gem.  In order to connect to DOR, you will need
some configuration information in your project, along with the certificates for the appropriate environment.  Connections for development DOR
are provided as part of the gem in the 'config' directory and are used in the spec test suite.
